**Memory Mime** is a Light & Sound Memory game to apply for CodePath's SITE Program. 

Submitted by: **Andrew Sanchez**

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [x] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [x] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [x] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [x] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [x] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [x] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [x] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [x] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [ ] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [ ] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [x] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 

Other than the recources provided by the prework, no outside sources were used to help me create this program.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 

One challenge that I had to overcome was getting used to the web development layout. Never before have I had to perform work with multiple
languages at the same time. This new format is pretty exciting, and coupled with my softspot with html, created a little confusion at first
as to how work with the files together. But after realizing that they behaved similarly to linked files of the same type, just having to trust
the process help significantly. The step by step process of creating the game filled any gaps I might have had myself, and consulting them when
I was unsure or a little puzzled about my layout told me exactly what I needed.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

My next questions would be on how to really polish the work you make on web design. Though my program is completlety functional,
it is crude and rough, and it would be great to add additional features and optimized design on different devices. There is so much
to consider where do you begin? Which desins are friendliest to write for? Are they go to functions to write for most web pages?
There is so much to learn so it would be fascinating to explore just how complex these layouts can optimally be.

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

Definitley any additional alloted time would go towards completing the optional features implemented that I couldn't perfomr myself. Some of these could be done simply, but others should have some time dedicated
to them to give proper attention to. Beyond those, with any additional time, would be to add more buttons or even an entire menu dedicated to changing the options that I have the freedom to change myself to the user.
Having a flexible program with sliders for length of pattern, amount of boxes, setting strikes, or even an infinite competitive mode where two player cold face off until one fails could be an interesting addition too!
